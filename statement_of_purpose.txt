The whole ambience of the home (decor, furniture and accessories) encourages a feeling of warmth, stability and security. The home interior has been carefully planned so as to give privacy but also enable young people to experience a safe and homely environment. 

Each young person has their own lockable bedroom allowing for both privacy and security. Bedrooms are fully furnished and provide a space to relax and study privately. Young people are encouraged and supported to personalise and maintain their own rooms.
The home has two young people’s bedrooms which are on the top floor, as well as a staff bedroom and a multipurpose room which can be used as per the needs of the home and the children who reside in it.

The home is well furnished and tastefully decorated throughout. The home has been refurbished to ensure that the appropriate privacy, hygiene facilities, laundry facilities and kitchen area are appropriate for use in a children’s home. The home has been adapted to ensure it meets fire and health and safety regulations.

Aylett Close is situated in Canvey Island; it is situated close to local bus routes and railway stations with easy reach to the main town.
Within walking distance from Aylett Close, you'll find a range of amenities, including shopping centers, parks, and cultural attractions. Canvey Island is known for its green spaces and proximity to various beaches, providing opportunities for outdoor activities and leisure. It's also home to various shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues, making it an accessible place for Children and Young People to explore. 
The home is near leisure centres and swimming pool, a large library, railway station, etc. Locally there are also primary, secondary schools, youth clubs, dance classes, football teams and drama groups, gyms, boxing club, and a huge variety of other clubs the young people can join.
The location also offers fantastic links to London by car or train. The A13 road allows the M25 to be reached in less than 20 minutes via car from our front door. The local railway station has regular trains which give access into the heart of London within an hour. 

At Aylett Close our Activity Policy is to encourage and consult all young people to participate in activities. These activities are put forward by the young people and members of staff after having a group discussion. Staff plan, organise and implement activities with assistance from their colleagues who may be on duty. Individual young people are also encouraged to pursue their own leisure interests, e.g. football, community activities, dancing, track and field athletic events, drama classes and community/cultural events. All young people are encouraged to participate as a group or as individuals and most importantly they are to have fun.  

If a young person’s school offers extra-curricular activities, then the young person is supported and encouraged to participate if they wish to do so.

We also try to encourage young people to participate in physical exercise and choose activities that they will enjoy doing. We appreciate that all young people have different individual needs with different skills, experience and abilities thus will have varying likes and dislikes. All their ideas are put forward and included within the weekly young person’s house meeting and added to their own individual activity plan.  

Essex Local Authority also has a local operation in place to protect young people who are at risk. The police also have an Anti-Social Behaviour, CSE, Vulnerability and Partnership Officer, who can liaise with the home regarding young people who regularly go missing from care, they also provide support and advice regarding other safeguarding issues that may affect the welfare of children.  

7. The arrangements for supporting the cultural, linguistic and religious needs of children.
7. The arrangements for supporting the cultural, linguistic and religious needs of children.

We aim to support the young people’s individual cultural needs within the homes. We employ a diverse staff team throughout the organisation. The staff come from a variety of different ethnic backgrounds or share different values, religions and beliefs and food. 

We support the young people to learn to respect and enjoy diversity. This enables them to develop their own cultural identity for now and the future.

All cultural needs are documented and reviewed within the young person placement plan, education plans and key working reports.

We acknowledge and respect the need for young people to maintain all important religious contacts and practices and will work to maintain these if the young person wishes to do so 

Where we have limited knowledge of a particular young person’s cultural or religious needs we will ensure that links are made within the community to seek the information that we will need to provide holistic care for that child. 

We welcome family and community support in meeting the cultural and religious needs of the individual.

Young people living with us may present with a variety of language needs or differences.
This can be supported on an individual assessment of how the home would best meet their needs,
e.g. an interpreter for meetings or contacts etc.

Young people are encouraged to celebrate and participate in religious observance, e.g. Ramadan, Eid, Diwali, Christmas, Birthdays and other religious festivals, which are displayed on the diversity calendar. The weekly menu also tries to reflect the specific religious celebrations.

Aylett Close is dedicated to providing a high-quality service, therefore we view all complaints seriously.
All residents of Aylett Close have the right to complain if they are worried or unhappy with the way that they are being treated. On admission, all young people are given their copy of the Children’s Guide, informing them of this right and the methods they can use to make their grievance known.
In the first instance, it is hoped that the complaint is of such a nature that the young person can feel confident enough to bring it to the attention of staff on duty or their key worker.

If the problem cannot be resolved at that level, then the care or key worker should write a statement of the complaint, and this should be given to the Registered Manager. 
If the problem cannot be dealt with internally, they will bring it to the attention of the young person’s family, and/or social worker and/or legal representative and/or their independent referee. 

If the problem can be dealt with internally, the young person can still contact or request that their family, and/or social worker and/or legal representative and/or their independent referee be contacted and 
informed of the problem.

In some cases, complaints may need serious investigation in which case the young person’s key worker or staff member must write a statement of complaint in the complaints log. A copy of the complaint will be placed on the young person’s file and a copy given to the young person.

Within seven days of being notified the unit manager will inform the young person of what action is being taken.

Any young person who discloses abuse by any adult/young person, must be treated with sensitivity and all child protection procedures started without delay.

Complaints are taken seriously, and we will resolve problems internally, within recognised time scales when and where appropriate. In addition, each young person, parent or member of the public can make a complaint known to, Ofsted. 

The home takes child protection seriously and has vigorous procedures in place to safeguard the young people accommodated; the home also follows strict guidelines in relation to behaviour management.

Safeguarding

It is our expectation that all staff members are trained and regularly refreshed in the area of safeguarding and child sexual exploitation.

In the event of risk of CSE the staff at Aylett Close will complete the CSE Risk Assessment (within the CSE Policy). This will be completed in conjunction with working with other professional agencies.

Essex Police have also implemented a Looked after Children New Arrival/CSE risk management information form that will be used in the event of a new placement or if CSE is suspected. 

The company has services that Aylett Close can call upon in cases where intensive support is required. This can come in the form of the EFT counsellor or behavioural Counsellor who can work with young people and staff in promoting the wellbeing of the young person.

The home’s safeguarding officer should be contacted in the first instance should you have a Safe-Guarding. This is Ahmed Jama.

The First Response Team will ensure that the matter is passed promptly to the designated officer (formerly LADO) and assist in initiating any priority safeguarding activities.


Missing from Home

The home has an ‘Absent/Missing Children’ Policy that provides the minimum standard for every young person living at the home.

	•	Each young person has an individualised missing from care risk management plan that determines the routes that the staff takes to prevent young people from going missing.
	•	Where a young person has a history of absconding on entering the home the Keyworker ensures sessions are held at the start of the placement to ask the young person what makes them want to abscond and what they think staff within the home could do to help change that.
	•	The home also looks at what each young person’s likes and dislikes and strengths are and what motivates them and incorporates this into the activity schedule to increase their participation within the home, in the hope that this will reduce the risk of them leaving the home without permission.

In specialised high- risk cases the basic missing from home procedure can be altered and extra measures put in place.

	•	This can involve such things as altering the time a young person is reported missing to the local police.
	•	Providing high staffing ratios for the young person.
	•	Supervising any monies and putting personalised incentives in place.
	•	Where any amendments are made to the missing from homes procedure these are agreed with the placing authority through the young person’s social worker and or parents /carers if appropriate.
	•	Where any intensive measures are put in place, the home works with the young person and the local authority on the longer- term goal of lowering the risk level and gradually reducing any extra measures put in place.
	•	The aim of this is to get young people to make safe choices independently so they are not overwhelmed by the freedom they have when they leave care.


In addition to this House boundary/Management boundary will be consulted throughout. Where a young person goes missing regular telephone and e-mail updates are given to social workers, family members (where applicable) and any other relevant parties.

If a young person is missing more than three times in one month or has been missing for a long duration the home’s Manager organises a meeting with the young person’s social worker and all relevant parties involved in safeguarding the young person. This allows an opportunity for everyone to discuss the behaviour, make an action plan for the young person’s safe return and set any amendments to the young person’s care plan.

Following the return of a young person to Aylett Close, staff will request a welfare check from an independent person as soon as possible and in line with Local Authorities policies, within a maximum of 72 hours. The independent person will complete a welfare check form, feedback information to the staff and where necessary, changes/actions can be put in place.

Where a young person is reported missing to the Police, staff are asked a series of questions regarding the young person’s prior history of being missing, the circumstances of the current incident and the behaviour leading up to the event, any other risks the young people present with, and what contact the young person has made. Depending on the answer to these questions, the police then risk assess the situation and act accordingly. Where a child is considered to be ‘missing’ a police officer may attend the home to collect and go through the information and search the home.

Where a young person is considered to as absent without authority they can remain so for up to 24 hours. This amount of time may be negotiated with the placing authority and with those with parental responsibility. After this, they must be reported to the local police as ‘missing’ from care as per Southend Essex Thurrock procedure (SET)
- Section 47 –Joint Protocol on Children Who Run Away or Go Missing from Home or Care, Between Essex Care
	•	Missing from Care, Memorandum of Understanding.


Bullying
Bullying is unacceptable within Aylett Close and will be challenged on an individual and group basis when encountered.
Aylett Close operates a zero-tolerance approach to bullying including verbal, physical and cyberbullying. This is outlined verbally to the young people when they first arrive at Aylett Close and they also have access to the anti-bullying procedure within the Aylett Close.

Young people are encouraged by staff to support them to keep the home free from bullying and to speak up if they are being bullied or know someone who is. As with safeguarding the staff member’s relationships with the young people is pivotal to this in terms of disclosures of bullying and also the likelihood that both bullies and bullying victims will accept support and help from staff. If a child/young person will not take responsibility for their behaviour and continue to pose a risk to other children/young people then a strategy meeting will be convened with the Social Worker to discuss strategies and options.

Bullying is an agenda item in the children’s meeting each week and is also discussed regularly in staff meetings and supervision. Any bullying or discrimination, including racism, will be recorded in the bullying/anti discriminatory log within the home. An action plan will be drawn up in consultation with the child/young person, staff team and other professionals involved in the care of the child/young person (where applicable). All incidents and occurrences of bullying or other discriminatory actions will be closely monitored within Aylett Close, education and community and recorded in the relevant logbooks.

Aylett Close staff will support both the victim and perpetrator of any bullying through 1:1 direct work sessions and education into cause and effects and the impact of bullying. We will also promote restorative resolution to enable the rebuilding of relationships.

At Aylett Close, we fully recognise that Children have their own views, wishes and feelings, and that we must promote each child's right to have a say.

Involvement In their own care
	•	The children and young people resident within the home will be consulted about every aspect of their care whilst in placement. This will be done both formally and informally using a variety of different means. No child is assumed unable to communicate their views; therefore, appropriate methods for gaining views should be sought and provided. For example, Children's views are sought during Key working 1:1 sessions, reviews and planning meetings.
	•	Children and young people will be actively encouraged to participate in the development of their individual care plans, reviews and any other key meetings and will be supported and encouraged to ensure their views are heard. 
	•	The children/young people will have opportunity to discuss, debrief and comment following any incident, consequences or use of positive physical intervention. This will consider how we can prevent this from happening again they will also have the opportunity to read and comment on their review reports, care and health plans. 
	•	The children/young people will have regular one to one sessions with their allocated worker to discuss continued needs, progress, any issues and to set targets for the next meeting.
	•	The Registered Manager is always available for the young people to speak to both openly and in private about anything that is troubling them.

In the running of the home:

	•	Aylett Close will have regular meetings to discuss and consult with the children about the operational aspects of the house. Children will contribute to these meetings and all children are invited to take part.
	•	These are child friendly and are age appropriate. Children are given the opportunity to make/voice informal complaints both during and after the meeting. Minutes are kept as a record of discussions and outcomes.
	•	The children are consulted and may participate in the recruitment process of staff.
	•	Children and young people are encouraged to personalise their bedrooms in line with their

individual tastes and interests, and will also be consulted about the décor of the home and purchasing new items or re decoration.
	•	The children and young people will also have regular monthly opportunity to discuss with the Regulation 44 inspector any concerns or issues they may have about the quality of care in the home. Any comments or concerns are raised and discussed with the Manager and appropriate action will be taken in response.
	•	Opportunities can be arranged for young people to discuss any concerns or issues with the Registered Manager, Responsible individual or the Regulation 44 Inspector.
	•	A record of the views of children and young people about the development of the home and the children will be regularly consulted throughout the year. Any ideas and suggestions put forward will be considered and the children will receive feedback from the consultation. 


We will ensure that Children are provided with information about how to contact the Children’s Commissioner, have access to a Children's Rights Officers (within the Placing Authority) and/or an Independent Advocate. 

Consultation with others

	•	The Registered Manager has regular consultation with professionals, families and significant others relating to the care of the child and operational running of the home as part of the Regulation 45 process.

	•	The home will ensure that any professionals and significant others including family where appropriate are kept informed of incidents, achievements and any concerns relating to the child. 

	•	Formal consultation about the care and operational running of the home forms part of the monthly Regulation 44 inspection. 

	•	The manager, as part of the annual review of the Home will ensure consultation with children and young people.

	•	Social Workers, Placing Authorities, families, significant others and other professionals inform the continued development of the service. 


In terms of participating in their care young people work closely with their Keyworkers on their care plan and are encouraged to discuss what they want for themselves for both the short- and long-term future. They discuss how they think they can reach these goals and what they feel they need to do in order to achieve this. 

All young people are given a copy of the home complaints policy and can have access to a telephone to make private phone calls within reasonable times. They are encouraged to share any concerns they have within the home either personally or anonymously if they are more comfortable to follow this route.

anti-discriminatory practice in respect of children and their families; and children’s rights.

Aylett Close is committed to equal opportunities and anti-discriminatory practice both in terms of the staff it employs and the children and young people it looks after.

At Aylett Close we believe that all people – colleagues, young people and visitors should be treated with respect.

Disruptive or offensive language or behaviour will not be tolerated and will always be challenged. When such incidents are perpetrated by young people they will be dealt with in a way that promotes better understanding and encourages a change of attitude and behaviour. If young people are subjected to discrimination they will be offered protection, comfort and support.

We believe that all young people are equally entitled to have their needs met and to be free from abuse and exploitation. Each young person will have a Keyworker who will explain to them their rights as a looked after child and consistently ensure that these are being met. There will be regular meetings between staff and young people where the issue of children’s rights will be addressed to ensure that young people feel that they are being consulted, listened to and treated equally and fairly. This will be evidenced in the children’s meetings, Keyworker sessions and 1-to-1 pieces of work.

Essex County Council’s Virtual School for Looked After Children provides a support role for schools and Local Authority teams in the form of staffing support; access to additional resources to support educational outcomes; information, advice and guidance (especially around Personal Education Plans); monitoring and tracking of educational outcomes and targets, and training and support at key transitional moments.

Facilities at Aylett Close

Each child and young person has access to facilities that will enable them to do their school homework.

A computer will be available in communal or study areas, access is made as safe, legal, and age appropriate as possible. 

Staff will be available to offer support and encouragement. Children and young people with learning difficulties will be provided with specialist help in order to ensure that their specific education or training requirements are met.

Children and young people can also access information from the staff team when possible. Staff would endeavour to obtain relevant up to date information to enable the children and young people to do their schoolwork.

All young people will have a preparation for Adulthood plan that will promote and encourage independence skills at a level appropriate to their needs.

Where young people come into the home with particular hobbies or skills they are actively encouraged to keep these going wherever practical. 

Part of the role the home has is to review leisure time and to stimulate a broader range of interests that can be kept up when the young person moves on from Aylett Close. 
This will be developed as part of the care plan and it is intended that there is planned and unstructured time.

We aim for each young person to have at least 1 ‘extra-curricular’ activity which involves him or her outside the home. 

We use this not only to develop self-esteem but also to broaden links and the possibilities of positive friendships with other children and young people in the Community.

There is a wide range of choice including horse riding, swimming, cycling, football clubs, tennis clubs, cricket clubs and ice-skating as well as more community-based activities such as guides, cadets and St John’s Ambulance.

There are also opportunities for group excursions to places of interest and theme parks.

An annual holiday takes place, where possible, which can be abroad and long weekends away. Half term breaks take place throughout the year.

Meetings are held between children and staff to encourage and promote participation in the recreational activities and establish an activity framework that benefits each child and is reflected in their individual
care plan. 

Whatever the activity, children will be supervised by appropriately trained staff and a focused risk assessment undertaken that does not limit the children’s chances of engaging in age-appropriate activities.

Any particular cultural activity that is required or requested by a young person will be met and incorporated into their routine and planners.

Aylett Close is not registered as a therapeutic community. However, we have access to a behavioural therapist on a freelance basis subject to Local Authority approval. The therapist is responsible for ensuring appropriate clinical supervision takes place
At Aylett Close we endeavour to ensure that the young people live in a healthy environment where their health needs are identified and promoted, and services provided to meet them.  

Staff have a significant role in promoting an awareness of health issues and healthy lifestyle. At a basic level, this includes providing good nutrition, ensuring adequate sleep and a proper and onerous regard for personal safety. 

The staff member provide children with the opportunity for good health but also work towards preparing them for taking care of their own personal health. 

Consent for medication and medical treatment is requested at the planning stage and must be present before any treatment can be given by staff. 

All aspects of healthy living can be addressed is appropriate, this can include sexual health, sexual exploitation, smoking, drugs and alcohol abuse. 

All children are registered with the local GP during the first week of placement. Should medication or a course of treatment be prescribed, a structure is in place that ensures that this treatment is followed. Children will undertake an annual health assessment. Whilst the focus is on the child’s emotional health, the child’s physical well-being is no less important. Children have regular optician’s appointments. Children receive dental checks and children are supported through any required treatment.

All children are encouraged to pay attention to their personal hygiene with support if required. Personal needs monies are available for the purchase of toiletries and specialist hair and skin treatments. We recognise that children from different ethnic backgrounds and cultures may have specific needs, which relate to their heritage. We will endeavour to liaise with specialist agencies and communities to ensure that the Health and cultural needs are met.  

A healthy lifestyle contributes to the positive outcome and attitude of children and we expect referring Authorities to provide all the necessary documentation required for children to meet their physical and health related needs.


17. The arrangements for promoting contact between children and their families and friends
17. The arrangements for promoting contact between children and their families and friends
Staff at Aylett Close work very hard at building good relationships with the parents and carers of children accommodated in the home where appropriate. Children will be supported and encouraged to maintain and develop family contacts and friendships, subject to any limitations set in their care plan or court order.

There is a private telephone area where young people can call friends and family. There are clear boundaries in place for the use of the telephone; calls must not be made after the young person has retired for the night. In emergency situations staff will permit use of the phone during these times and if calls are made during the night they will be monitored closely by the sleeping in staff on duty.
Where young people’s family and friends wish to visit the home, staff can arrange this provided it is safe to do so for the young person, their family member, staff and other residents. When friends or family visit the home, refreshments are always provided and young people given their privacy.

For those young people who do not have contact, the home will liaise with the local authority in promoting that young people have access to an independent visitor/advocate. We regret that overnight accommodation for visitors is not provided at the home although there is a good deal of accommodation available locally.

Aylett Close recognises the importance of attachment related issues for its young people and the difficulties that can arise in being apart from family. This can sometimes create issues prior to, during and after contact. Staff are mindful of this and ensure that where contact takes place there is good communication between parents and the home and young people and the home on how the contact went. The home has its own vehicle. All staff that are in possession of a full drivers licence and wish to drive are insured to drive the homes vehicles by head office.

Aylett Close supports transportation to and from education, appointments and family contact. The home’s staff members use the home’s young person’s calendar when planning such things in and try to arrange appointments and contact for a date and time where the vehicle is not needed for any other things. This is not always possible and at times other methods of transportation need to be explored.

Any staff members who are willing to use their own cars must ensure they have business insurance added on to their insurance policy before they will be allow to transport any young person in their vehicle and that the vehicle is in a safe condition when transporting the young people. This is checked annually by admin.

Aylett Close has policies which cover the use of Door Alarms which is reviewed annually.

To ensure the safety of the young person or others the front door is fitted with an alarm which is sounded as and when the front door is opened.

Every effort is made to ensure the child's privacy, dignity and rights whilst the system is in use.

	•	The child is made fully aware of its use and the reasons for this.
	•	We can de-activate the door alarm if needed this will be risk assessed and all relevant parties would be informed and consulted on an individual basis.


All staff has telephone access to the Home’s senior staff for support/guidance by way of 24hr x 7 day a week on call person out of hours.

Aylett Close also has installed CCTV to cover the front of the building and all CCTV cameras have audio facilities. 


Aylett Close will use Location locating apps which can be installed on both the child’s phone and staff phones only in order to locate a child if they have gone missing or they are in a place where they are not sure of returning back home. Applications like Live 360 will be installed only if the Local Authority give the go ahead and authorisation for their designated young person.

In its vision for Aylett Close, the registered manager is committed to making Aylett Close a place where all people can thrive: living, working and learning in a clean, safe and healthy environment and specifically the company is committed to improving outcomes for Children. This behaviour management policy is intended to be a framework that will:

	•	Ensure that children and young people with difficulties of self-control are cared for in ways which are sensitive to their needs.
	•	Provide safeguards for staff in this rewarding, though sometimes difficult role.
	•	Ensure that the safety of both children and staff is treated as equally important.
	•	Throughout this document the term “child” or “children” should be taken to refer to both children and young people.

Physical Intervention
When caring for children/young people who display extremes of behaviour, it is sometimes appropriate to use physical intervention as a method of care and control, to ensure the safety of the child/young person and those who care for them. Physical intervention is always a last resort; after all other interventions have been exhausted. Physical intervention is a reality of the work undertaken, but Aylett Close, in line with the policy, works hard to decrease the need for intervention. Our belief is that the cycle of assessment, monitoring, evaluation and review allows for proactive planning rather than reactive action.

All staff members are trained in Care and Control of Children and Young People. There is an emphasis on developing a skill base that enables control and boundaries without the need for physical restraint. Staff will receive training in acceptable forms of restraint and will be supported through regular supervision. The restraint techniques used are taught through Team teach and/or The Training Hub. The staff have a physical assessment at the end of the training to ensure they are competent in using the techniques taught.
All physical interventions used are recorded, and these reports are monitored by the Registered Manager,

Responsible Individual, Regulation 44 Visitor.

All significant incidents and incidents requiring restraint are recorded and will include a written debrief and comments by the child/young person. The Manager/deputy manager will read, comment and sign every incident and restraint report. The antecedents are important in ensuring all responses are appropriate and in line with the risk assessment and child’s behaviour plan.


Consequences

Aylett Close operates a policy of imposing clear and concise boundaries that children/young people must be able to understand. If the child/young person repeatedly challenges or breaks boundaries then a consequence may be imposed. Any consequence is given on the basis that it is within the comprehension of the child/young person, reasonable and relevant to the behaviour.

The child/young person will be given the opportunity to discuss any consequences imposed. All consequences are monitored by the Manager/Deputy Manager who will look at the effectiveness of the consequence, and any patterns of behaviour developing.

Where willful damage or theft has occurred, the child/young person will be encouraged to make reparations in accordance with good practice.

Rewards systems are in place that promote positive behaviour and each goal or target is individually created in response to the needs of each child.

All measures are entered in the record of Consequences and Rewards.

The young people who come to Aylett Close are generally for short to long term placement. We aim to provide stability and we will work with the young person, their family, social worker and other professionals to achieve the following positive outcomes:

	•	Rehabilitation to support the young person to return home.
	•	Preparing the young person for fostering.
	•	Preparing the young person for independence. 

It should also be expected that the “needs” specified within the referral or care plan and/or social work assessment should relate to the type of living and educational programmes and provision that Aylett Close is able to deliver.

	•	Aylett Close does not offer secure accommodation, or a remand facility, nor is it a “therapeutic” community home.
	•	Aylett Close can offer a variety of different services and activities. Any specific services or activities should be identified and discussed with the managers during the referral process.
	•	Young people should be aged between 7 and 17 on admission.
	•	The Management will consider the welfare of other young people in the consideration of referrals. This consideration will include an matching process.
	•	A visit to Aylett Close by the referring Social Worker is essential with the young person prior to admission.
	•	It is expected that the Social Worker will make a commitment, in the Care Plan, to make regular visits to the young people they represent not only just at times of crisis or for meetings.
	•	Emergency referrals can be admitted.

When a referral is made to the home then the Children’s commissioning services and Social worker must first decide that the children’s home has the skills and capacity to meet the individual needs of the child. A detailed referral form to be completed by the allocated social worker. Social worker should then ideally, visit the Home and meet with staff and a mutual agreement is made that Aylett Close can meet the child’s individual’s needs.

When an admission is agreed, the following must then be on file for that young person: Initial Placement Risk Assessment undertaken.
	•	Essential information.
	•	Placement Plan.
	•	Any up to date Care Plans.
	•	Appropriate background reports.
	•	Any updated “screening of mental health needs for children” (if available).
	•	Placement Referral Form.
	•	Personal education Plan if available
	•	Consent for medical treatment and medication

It is highly recommended that a Pre-Admissions Meeting is held to:

	•	Share relevant information.

	•	Identify the process of meeting the care needs referred to in the placement plan.
	•	Discuss risk issues.
	•	Discuss management issues.
	•	Identify the desired outcomes for the child whilst cared for at the home.
	•	Agree admission process. This should whenever possible include visiting the young person and them visiting the home.

Within the first 72 hours of admission a Placement Planning meeting should take place, this will look at any specific health needs, safeguarding issues, leisure needs, religious needs, contact arrangements and living skills, and if the placement is suitable both for the young person and the home.
If information is not provided or meetings do not happen at agreed timescales then this may place the placement at risk.

Within 28 days of admission, a Looked After Child Review should be convened by the allocated social worker in order to:

	•	Agree the placement and Care Plan.
	•	Detail the specific purpose and outcome of the placement.
	•	Detail the specific roles of all professionals involved in the child’s life:
	•	Aylett Close does not primarily function as an emergency resource. However, on occasions such admissions will occur.

Emergency placements will be considered dependent on the needs of the young person requiring the placement and whether they are compatible with existing young people.

Where emergency placement is sought, the following procedure will apply:

	•	Placements officer/ referring social worker enquires about placement for child.
	•	Initial Request for Placement referral Form and Pre-Admission Risk Assessment is forwarded to the placements officer/ referring social worker for completion.
	•	Completed forms are returned to Aylett Close.
	•	Written agreement is provided of risk management plan and discussions are recorded.
	•	Upon receipt of the above information, the manager will carry out a Review of the Pre- Admission Risk Assessment.

An immediate decision as to whether the referral is suitable will be made. In doing so the manager will consider the following:

	•	Does the home have all the information necessary to make a decision?
	•	Can Aylett Close provide services to meet the needs of the young person?
	•	Will the young person have a positive or detrimental effect on the provision of care for existing young people in the home?
	•	Is the support being offered to the young person by the placing authority sufficient? If not, what additional support will be required?

The placements officer will be contacted to arrange a time for the admission of the young person. On arrival a planning meeting will take place with the young person, this should be at the time but definitely within 72 hours.

At the first LAC review after 28 days, a decision will be made as to the suitability of the placement.
